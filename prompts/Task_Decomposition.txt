	# GENERAL TASK DECOMPOSITION     # Decompose and parallelize subtasks where ever possible    # Independent subtasks:    
	# SubTask 1: Search for banana. (Skills Required: navigation, object_detection)    
	# SubTask 2: Search for apple. (Skills Required: navigation, object_detection)    # We can parallelize SubTask 1 and SubTask 2 because they don't depend on each other.

# 0: SubTask 1: Search for banana        
# 1: Go to the banana.        navigation('banana')        
# 2: detect banana.        object_detection('banana')    def Search for apple():
